# lcdtool
The idea is to create a console application for driving the Raspberry Pi via the 1602 LCD module using the WiringPi library and embedded Python. Why so complex?
Just for fun. I want to build on it some extensible interface for my music player.

Somethings are working here:

* Display backlight;
* Keyboard events;
* Display output.
